# Different stages in CI/CD pipeline and the policies and checks that can be enforced at each stage.
stages:
  - stage: pre-commit
    checks-performed:
      - secret detection
      - linting
      - local unit tests
    examples:
      - prevent commiting secrets
      - enforce code style
      - require passing tests

  - stage: build (CI)
    checks-performed:
      - static code analysis (SAST)
      - dependency scanning (SBOM)
      - license check
    examples:
      - disallow use of vulnerable libraries
      - block GPL-licensed packages

  - stage: test (CI)
    checks-performed:
      - unit/integration tests
      - code coverage checks
      - API contract validation
    examples:
      - minimum test coverage policy
      - fail on contract mismatch

  - stage: security-scanning
    checks-performed:
      - SAST/DAST
      - secret scanning
      - IaC analysis
    examples:
      - block deploy if critical/high vulnerabilities
      - deny hardcoded keys
      - validate terraform security

  - stage: build-artifact
    checks-performed:
      - sign artifacts
      - generate SBOMs
      - upload to registry
    examples:
      - enforce artifact integrity
      - require signed images

  - stage: approval-gate
    checks-performed:
      - manual or automatic, based on rules
    examples:
      - require security view for prod
      - block deploys on certain days

  - stage: deploy (CD)
    checks-performed:
      - apply IaC
      - apply secrets/config
      - run db migrations
    examples:
      - enforce tagging / versioning
      - require TLS endpoints
      - prohibit test creds in production

  - stage: post-deploy
    checks-performed:
      - health checks
      - monitoring alert setup
      - end-to-end tests
    examples:
      - require passing smoke tests
      - validate logging and monitoring are in place
